#!/bin/bash = SHEBANG - the intial piece of information found in a file to be executed. This allows the terminal to know which form of language should be used.

-Bash is more streamlined as its directly attached to the system. Shells are emulators that have fewer features than a terminal but still allows commands to be passed.

- ./Filename = runs the script
