/** A header file is a file with extension .h
 which contains C function declarations and macro
 definitions to be shared between several source files.
 All lines that start with # are processed by a preprocessor
 which is a program invoked by the compiler. **/
 /** Header Files for C **/
 /** stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
    stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
    stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
    stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions,

 /** Main Method Declaration **/
 /**It is the entry point of a C program and the execution
 typically begins with the first line of the main(). The 
 empty brackets indicate that the main doesn’t take any 
 parameter. The int that was 
 written before the main indicates the return type of main().
 The value returned by the main indicates the status of program
 termination.**/

 /** integers **/
printf("%d", b);
 /** Statement **/
 /**Statements are the instructions given to the compiler. In C,
 a statement is always terminated by a semicolon (;) **/
return 0;
 /** Return Statement **/
 /**The last part of any C function is the return statement. The
 return statement refers to the return values from a function.
 This return statement and return value depend upon the return
 type of the function. The return statement in our program
 returns the value from main(). The returned value may be used
 by an operating system to know the termination status of your
 program. The value 0 typically means successful termination.**/ 
}
/** Body of main (Lines 27-32) **/
/** The body of a function in the C program refers to statements that
are a part of that function. It can be anything like manipulations,
searching, sorting, printing, etc. A pair of curly brackets define
the body of a function. All functions must start and end with curly brackets.
