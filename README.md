This is a journey of my path into becoming a machine learning engineer. Every task provided is something that i went to when i needed guidance in this journey and i can only hope it does the same for you....

The first thing I began searching for was a complete series for understanding bash on youtube that was comfortable enough to listen to as i casually went through my day. I find that my learning style encompasses a balance of repetitive codinng paired with audio reinforcement throughout the day. Thats when i came across the Hackersploit series on Shell Scripting. After sitting through the introductory video, i think its safe to say this is a perfect place to start the journey.
