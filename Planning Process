Project: Command-Line Task Manager

Step 1: Define the Project Scope

Purpose: Create a command-line program to manage tasks.
Goals: Allow users to add, list, and mark tasks as done.
Constraints: The program should be text-based and run in the terminal.
Step 2: Gather Requirements

Features:
Add a task with a title and description.
List all tasks.
Mark a task as done.
Constraints:
Tasks should persist between program runs (store them in a file).
Users should have a simple and intuitive interface (text-based).
Step 3: Break Down the Project

Tasks:
Set up the project structure.
Implement task addition functionality.
Implement task listing functionality.
Implement task completion functionality.
Implement data persistence.
Create a user-friendly menu.
Step 4: Create a Timeline

Week 1: Set up the project and implement task addition.
Week 2: Implement task listing and completion.
Week 3: Add data persistence and create a user menu.
Week 4: Testing, debugging, and documentation.
Step 5: Design the Architecture

Main components:
Task structure (to store task data).
Functions for adding, listing, and marking tasks.
File I/O functions for data persistence.
User interface functions.
Step 6: Write Pseudocode

plaintext
Copy code
1. Initialize a list of tasks.
2. Display a menu to the user.
3. Based on the user's choice:
   - If they choose to add a task:
     a. Prompt for task title and description.
     b. Create a new task with the input data and add it to the list.
   - If they choose to list tasks:
     a. Display all tasks in the list.
   - If they choose to mark a task as done:
     a. Prompt for the task number to mark as done.
     b. Mark the selected task as done.
   - If they choose to exit:
     a. Save tasks to a file.
     b. Exit the program.
4. Repeat the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Step 7: Choose Development Tools

Code Editor: Use a code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks).
Compiler: You can use GCC, a popular C compiler.
Debugger: GCC also includes the GDB debugger.
Step 8: Plan for Error Handling

Handle cases such as invalid input, file I/O errors, and incorrect task numbers.
Step 9: Test Plan

Test adding, listing, and marking tasks.
Test error scenarios (e.g., entering non-numeric input for task numbers).
Test data persistence by exiting and relaunching the program.
Step 10: Version Control

Set up a Git repository for your project to track changes.
Step 11: Documentation

Add comments to your code for clarity.
Create a simple user manual explaining how to use the program.
Step 12: Communication

If working with a team, hold regular meetings to discuss progress and issues.
Step 13: Budget

No budget is required for this project, as it's purely software-based.
Step 14: Risk Assessment

Risks may include data corruption, user interface issues, or programming bugs. Have backup plans and strategies to mitigate these risks.
Step 15: Start Coding

Begin implementing the project, following your pseudocode and design.
