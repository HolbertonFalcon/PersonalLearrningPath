Step 1: Define the Project Scope

Purpose: Clearly state the purpose of your project. In this case, the purpose is to create a command-line task manager.

Goals: Specify what you want to achieve with your program. For our task manager, the goals are to allow users to add, list, and mark tasks as done.

Constraints: Set any limitations or constraints for your project. In this case, the program should be text-based and run in the terminal.

Step 2: Gather Requirements

Features: List the features your program should have.

Add a task with a title and description.
List all tasks.
Mark a task as done.
Constraints: Define any specific conditions or limitations for your project.

Tasks should persist between program runs (store them in a file).
Users should have a simple and intuitive interface (text-based).
Step 3: Break Down the Project

Tasks: Divide your project into smaller, manageable tasks or modules.
Set up the project structure.
Implement task addition functionality.
Implement task listing functionality.
Implement task completion functionality.
Implement data persistence.
Create a user-friendly menu.
Step 4: Create a Timeline

Create a timeline to estimate the time required for each task or module. For example:
Week 1: Set up the project and implement task addition.
Week 2: Implement task listing and completion.
Week 3: Add data persistence and create a user menu.
Week 4: Testing, debugging, and documentation.
Step 5: Design the Architecture

Main Components: Identify the main components or modules of your program.
Task structure: Define a structure to store task data, including a title, description, and completion status.
Functions: Create functions for adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as done, and any other necessary functionality.
File I/O: Plan functions for reading from and writing to a file for data persistence.
User Interface: Consider how you'll present the menu to the user and handle user input.
Step 6: Write Pseudocode

Write pseudocode to outline the program's logic without worrying about syntax. Here's a simplified example:
plaintext
Copy code
1. Initialize a list of tasks.
2. Display a menu to the user.
3. Based on the user's choice:
   - If they choose to add a task:
     a. Prompt for task title and description.
     b. Create a new task with the input data and add it to the list.
   - If they choose to list tasks:
     a. Display all tasks in the list.
   - If they choose to mark a task as done:
     a. Prompt for the task number to mark as done.
     b. Mark the selected task as done.
   - If they choose to exit:
     a. Save tasks to a file.
     b. Exit the program.
4. Repeat the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Step 7: Choose Development Tools

Select the development environment and tools you'll use for coding in C, such as a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code), a compiler (e.g., GCC), and a debugger (e.g., GDB).
Step 8: Plan for Error Handling

Identify potential errors and how you'll handle them. For example:
Handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input for task numbers).
Deal with file I/O errors (e.g., file not found or permission issues).
Step 9: Test Plan

Plan how you'll test your program to ensure it works correctly.
Test adding, listing, and marking tasks.
Test error scenarios.
Test data persistence by exiting and relaunching the program.
Step 10: Version Control

Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to your code.
Step 11: Documentation

Add comments to your code for clarity.
Create a simple user manual explaining how to use the program.
Step 12: Communication

If working with a team, hold regular meetings to discuss progress and issues.
Step 13: Budget

No budget is required for this project, as it's purely software-based.
Step 14: Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks, such as data corruption, UI issues, or programming bugs. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks.
Step 15: Start Coding

Begin implementing the project one step at a time, following your pseudocode and design. Use C programming concepts like structs, functions, and file I/O to build the functionality.
